# Mountain Travel and Planner App (ML)
A travel-planner mobile application which specialize in mountain hiking. This project intended to fulfill Bangkit Academy 2022 program.

### Dataset
There are three datasets used in this project : 
* Mountains, which is list of mountains available in Sumatra, Jawa, Bali and Nusa Tenggara. Some details information provided are included id, name, description, location, level of difficulty and whether it still active or not.
* Users, which is list of dummy users with detail information such as id, name, email, phone and address. 
* Ratings, whish is list of previous trips from all dummy user and how they rate it in scale of 1-5. Each users are assigned to  at least three to ten previous hiking trips. 

Since there are no suitable datasets available online, we decided to made our own datasets. For mountain dataset, the data were crawled manually from various online site. For users and ratings dataset, both were purely made through some process of randomization.
